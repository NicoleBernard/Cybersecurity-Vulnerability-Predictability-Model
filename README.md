# Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-Predictability-Model
This model shows an effective way for vulnerability management, predictability and cost modeling and a demo simulation of the model

The purpose of this model is to create a cybersecurity vulnerability cost model that predicts the costs of each vulnerability and how much impact each vulnerability will cost each to prevent a potential attack if the network is infiltrated. Enterprises use common vulnerabilities to secure their companies and to prevent attacks. This model will estimate the cost to fix each vulnerability as a preventative measure. 

The model will be using the Monte Carlo Simulation to predict the likely hood of an attack if the vulnerability is not fixed. The model uses the data from each published CVE  that is provided by the national institute of standards and technology. This data will use the vulnerabilities that are present for a demo company to show how to predict the cost and likelihood of each vulnerability.
